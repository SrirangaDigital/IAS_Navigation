                 PUBLICATIONS ACTIVITY
                
                 Among the activities undertaken by the Academy since 1934, publication 
                  of scientific journals has occupied the pride of place. This 
                  programme is characterized by the basic philosophy that no journal 
                  published by the Academy will be in competition with other similar 
                  ones published in the country; that the Academy will co-operate 
                  with other agencies in bringing out its journals; that papers 
                  for publication need not be communicated by Fellows; and that 
                  all papers submitted would be subject to scrutiny by referees.
                  
                  The first issue of the Academy Proceedings appeared in July 
                  1934 as a monthly and it soon became two monthlies in July 1935, 
                  one section devoted to physical sciences and the other to life 
                  sciences. In 1973, a new physics journal entitled Pramana was 
                  added. In 1977, the publications programme was considerably 
                  enlarged with the two sections of Proceedings split into several 
                  theme journals devoted to mathematics, chemistry, earth and 
                  planetary sciences, plant sciences, animal sciences, and modern 
                  biology. New journals in materials science and astrophysics 
                  and astronomy were added. In 1985, the Academy took over and 
                  revived the Journal of Genetics, the oldest journal of its kind 
                  in the English language. The latest addition to the list of 
                  journals entitled Resonance is aimed at improving the quality 
                  of science education and teaching. The Academy also collaborates 
                  with Current Science Association in bringing out a fortnightly 
                  interdisciplinary journal Current Science, published since 1932. 
                  The number of journals currently published by the Academy is 
                  eleven covering all major disciplines in science and technology. 
                  The Academy is now considered as the single largest scientific 
                  publisher in the country.
                  
                  Besides regular journals, special publications of topical interest 
                  are frequently brought out. <!--The Academy also has an agreement 
                  with Universities Press India to help in publication and marketing 
                  of special publications.-->

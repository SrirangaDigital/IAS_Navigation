<p>PUBLICATIONS ACTIVITY</p>
<p>
	Among the activities undertaken by the Academy since 1934, publication 
	of scientific journals has occupied the pride of place. This 
	programme is characterized by the basic philosophy that no journal 
	published by the Academy will be in competition with other similar 
	ones published in the country; that the Academy will co-operate 
	with other agencies in bringing out its journals; that papers 
	for publication need not be communicated by Fellows; and that 
	all papers submitted would be subject to scrutiny by referees.

	The first issue of the Academy Proceedings appeared in July 
	1934 as a monthly and it soon became two monthlies in July 1935, 
	one section devoted to physical sciences and the other to life 
	sciences. In 1973, a new physics journal entitled Pramana was 
	added. In 1977, the publications programme was considerably 
	enlarged with the two sections of Proceedings split into several 
	theme journals devoted to mathematics, chemistry, earth and 
	planetary sciences, plant sciences, animal sciences, and modern 
	biology. New journals in materials science and astrophysics 
	and astronomy were added. In 1985, the Academy took over and 
	revived the Journal of Genetics, the oldest journal of its kind 
	in the English language. The latest addition to the list of 
	journals entitled Resonance is aimed at improving the quality 
	of science education and teaching. The Academy also collaborates 
	with Current Science Association in bringing out a fortnightly 
	interdisciplinary journal Current Science, published since 1932. 
	The number of journals currently published by the Academy is 
	eleven covering all major disciplines in science and technology. 
	The Academy is now considered as the single largest scientific 
	publisher in the country.

	Besides regular journals, special publications of topical interest 
	are frequently brought out.

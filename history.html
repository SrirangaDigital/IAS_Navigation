</p>
<p>
	The Academy was founded in 1934 by Professor 
	C. V. Raman (Nobel Laureate) and was registered as a Society 
	under the Societies Registration Act, on 24 April 1934. The 
	formal inauguration took place on 31 July 1934 with 65 Founding 
	Fellows. On the same day, the first general meeting of Fellows 
	was held at which C. V. Raman was elected its President, and 
	the draft constitution of the Academy was approved and adopted. 
	The first issue of the Academy "Proceedings" appeared in two 
	sections in July 1934. Since then, the "Proceedings" were 
	split into theme journals and several new ones added.

<p>The Academy presently has 1010 Fellows, 52 Honorary Fellows, and 53 Associates on its rolls.</p>

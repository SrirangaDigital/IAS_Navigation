                    are taken up for study and discussions at various fora of

                  </p><p>In recent years the Academy 
                    has felt increasingly concerned with the state of university 
                    education in science in the country. It has been widely realized 
                    that without a proper base in education, it will be difficult 
                    to promote progress in science to attain excellence that is 
                    a major concern of the academy. Reflecting this concern the 
                    Council set up a science education panel, which prepared a 
                    report titled <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/initiat/sci_ed/report.html">'University education in science'</a> (December 1994) to study 
                    the problem and to spell out the action that can be taken 
                    by the Academy and other agencies in the country. 
</p><p>In August 2006 the Indian 
National Science Academy (INSA) and the Indian Academy of Sciences 
jointly prepared and submitted recommendations to the country's Planning
 Commission for implementation in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. This 
document, titled <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/academy/misc_docs/sci_edu-insa_ias.pdf">'Higher education in science and research &amp; development: the challenges and the road ahead</a>
 (PDF file, 160 kbytes), made proposals to improve higher education in 
science, give a fillip to R&amp;D, and make India more competitive 
globally.
</p><p>In October 2008 the Academy prepared a 'Position paper' titled <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/academy/misc_docs/Four-year-BS-position-paper.pdf">'Restructuring post-school science teaching programmes'</a>
 (PDF file, 770 kbytes) on behalf of the three national science 
academies of India, explaining the limitations of the present system of 
post-school science education in India and proposing introduction of a 
four-year BS programme.

                    <br>
                    This monthly journal published since January 1996 carries 
                    articles in all areas of science. It 
                    is aimed generally at the undergraduate level, with some 
                    material accessible at the 12th standard level and some at 
                    the master's. Each issue highlights the life and work of a 
                    famous scientist with a specially executed cover portrait. 
                    Book review, Article-in-a-box, Classics, Reflection, Nature 
                    watch are some of the attractive features of every issue. 
                    Subscription prices are heavily subsidized and affordable for individuals 
                    and institutions alike. The editorial board has scientists 
                    from across the country.<br>

                  <p>Over the years, with the help of its fellowship, 
                    the Academy has built up a database of motivated teachers 
                    from colleges and universities in the country. A select list 
                    of these teachers are invited to participate in the Academy 
                    scientific meeting which provides opportunities to teachers 
                    to attend lectures and to meet and interact with fellows.<br>

                  <p>This is an all India programme to help teachers 
                    improve their background knowledge and teaching skills. The 
                    duration is two weeks and approximately 30 teachers undergo 
                    a rigorous course of lectures, discussions and problem-solving 
                    sessions. The Academy meets the train fare and full boarding 
                    and lodging expenses of all participants. A list of the refreshers 
                    courses so far held and planned appears elsewhere.<br>

                  <p>Academy arranges two or three-day lecture 
                    programmes on carefully chosen topics at selected college 
                    and university departments for local students and teachers. 
                    Speakers include Fellows and others from nearby institutions. 
                    Academy meets travel expenses of speakers, and host institution 
                    provides their hospitality and local expenses.<br>

                    4. Summer fellowships</p>
                  <p>Summer Fellowships are awarded to bright 
                    students and motivated teachers to work with Fellows of the 
                    Academy on research-oriented projects. Approximately 400 such 
                    fellowships to students and 100 fellowships to teachers are 
                    offered every year with travel and living expenses paid. Announcements 
                    inviting applications appear in Resonance and Current 
                    Science around November–December, and the selected 
                    applicants, notified by February–March, can avail the 
                    fellowships for two months during the summer. Since inception, 
                    about 1030 students and 270 teachers have availed these fellowships. 
                    From 2007, the two other national academies in the country 
                    — Indian National Science Academy (New Delhi) and National 
                    Academy of Sciences (Allahabad) — joined this programme.<br>

                  <p>5.Project Lifescape</p>
                  <p>This project is part of the Academy
 initiative 
                    to enhance the quality of science education. It is 
pursued in collaboration with the Centre for Ecological Sciences at the 
Indian Institute of Science to spread biodiversity literacy, expecially 
within the high school and college student community, and to involve 
them in collecting information at first hand on the status and ongoing 
changes in ecological habitats and a selected set of species of 
considerable human significance. It also aims to publish 
                    illustrated accounts of 1500 Indian species of 
micro-organisms, 
                    plants and animals. These accounts are meant to 
assist high 
                    school, college and postgraduate students and 
teachers of 
                    biology in reliably identifying these taxa. They 
would also 
                    include ancillary information on distribution, 
ecology and 
                    behaviour that would help design field exercises and
 projects 
                    focusing on first-hand observations of living 
organisms. The 
                    information thus generated could feed into a 
countrywide system 
                    of monitoring ongoing changes in India's lifescape 
to support 
                    efforts at conservation of biological diversity, as 
well as 
                    control of invasive, of weeds, pests, vectors and 
diseases. 
                    Hopefully, the accounts would also stimulate popular
 interest 
                    in the broader spectrum of India's biological 
wealth.</p>
<p> The project has thus far produced four books, Butterflies of Peninsular India, Freshwater Fishes of Peninsular India, Amphibians of Peninsular India, and <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/initiat/sci_ed/lifescape/odonates.html">Dragonflies and Damselflies of Peninsular India - A Field Guide</a>(available in the form of three PDF files <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/initiat/sci_ed/lifescape/odonates.html">freely downloadable</a> from this website). </p>
<p> The project is now focussing on generating CD-based 
and Web-based resource material, including interactive identification 
keys and a relational database management system that will organize 
validation, integration, analysis and sharing of data collected in a 
networked fashion. It aims to use these data to put together an 
all-India picture and make it available as a transparent, publicly 
accessible database through a website. Project Lifescape has also 
initiated work using some Indian languages.

                  </p><p><b>Scientific data of public interest</b>
</p><p> There has been widespread concern that the 
                    enormous storehouse of scientific data is not being put to 
                    sufficient use both in scientific research as well as economic 
                    and industrial activity. The main reason appears to be problems 
                    in gaining access to these data. A <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/initiat/data/data_termsref.html#panel">panel</a> 
                    was constituted with suitable <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/initiat/data/data_termsref.html">terms 
                    of reference</a> to study this question. Geographical data 
                    was first taken up to be followed up data on others by areas 
                    like meteorology, oceanography, and public health.</p>

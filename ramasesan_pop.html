                    Medal 85; Padma Bhushan. Sc. Work in X-ray Crystallography, 
                    Optics, Condensed Matter Physics, Materials Science. In Crystallography 
                    established the oultiwave anomalous X-ray scattering method 
                    for the determination of phases of reflection; partial structure 
                    factors of binary liquids and glasses; static displacements; 
                    and polarization vectors. Proposed the us; of anomalous neutron 
                    scattering for soliing very large structures. Showed that 
                    the resistivity anomaly in liquid caesium is due to anomalous 
                    electron scattering during the Fermi 6s-5d electron collapse. 
                    Formulated and verified laws governing cleavages in crystals. 
                    Discovered the icosahedral coordination in ionic solids. Developed 
                    new techniques for low temperature crys-tallography. In Optics: 
                    Fresnel diffraction in transparent spheres and spheroids; 
                    the optical activity of neutrons in halimagnetic structures; 
                    the identity of the Pancharatnam spherical excess theorem 
                    with the Berry Phase; the monograph on Crystal optics based 
                    on the Poincare sphere. In Condensed matter physics established 
                    the first high pressure laboratory in India; predicted pressure-induced 
                    optical activity; predicted and verified the existence of 
                    pressure-induce a liquid crystallinity; determined the critical 
                    point in solid-solid isostructural transformation of SmS. 
                    In Materials Science established the first materials science 
                    laboratory in India. Designed and fabricated the first nutation 
                    damper for India's satellite Aryabhata; FRP porous tubes for 
                    desalination; materials and processes for India's first heart 
                    valve prosthesis.

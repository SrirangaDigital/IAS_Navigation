                  6. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
                  
                  General Recommendations 
                  
                  Functioning of Colleges and Universities
                  
                    Universities and colleges should satisfy the minimum requirement of running on schedule in all respects. 
                    
                    Properly implemented continuous teacher training programmes must 
                      be established. 
                      
                    Council urges adoption of a three-stream system of university education 
                      in science, along the lines set out in Section 4 of the 
                      text. 
                      
                    It is urged that new institutions or centres created should 
                      be within the overall university system, but administratively 
                      independent and autonomous. 
                  
                    Academic  cooperation between educational institutions and national 
                    laboratories should be strongly encouraged, including joint 
                    research and teaching programmes and identification of adjunct 
                    faculty.  
                  
                  Role of Government Agencies and Industry 
                  
                    Funding of colleges and universities must improve, and quality science 
                      education centres should be started at a few places at least. 
                      
                    Accreditation of science departments in universities and colleges, to 
                      be reviewed periodically, should be carried out by an autonomous 
                      central body. 
                      
                    The pioneering efforts of DBT in the life sciences, and NBHM 
                      in mathematics, should be expanded upon and emulated by 
                      other major agencies such as DAE, DOE ' ISRO and DST; these 
                      agencies should support selected M.Sc. programmes in basic 
                      sciences, without early specialisation. 
                      
                    Individual industries and industry associations with common interests 
                      should award scholarships at the P.G. level, and support 
                      laboratories with funds and supplies. International agencies 
                      like UNESCO should also be approached for similar support. 
                      
                    Wide publicity should be given to all educational opportunities, 
                      aid to career opportunities in industry and elsewhere for 
                      science degree holders. 
                      
                  Academy Initiatives 
                  
                  Efforts by the Academy through the Fellowship
                  
                    An Academy Committee will be set up to study how the twin aims 
                      of equity and excellence may be achieved by a suitably reoriented 
                      system of science education. 
                      
                    The Academy will commission the preparation of two volumes to 
                      indicate what the desirable levels are in each area of science 
                      for a student at the B.Sc. and M.Sc. levels, and at the 
                      threshold of research. The volumes could also describe course 
                      combinations and careers. 
                      
                    The Academy will commission the writing of monographs and lecture 
                      note's as necessary at different levels. 
                      
                    The Academy will commission documentation on 100 experiments 
                      in each of the basic sciences, using inexpensive commonly 
                      available materials, with the objective of bringing out 
                      principles in an appealing way. 
                      
                    The Academy will cooperate with or sponsor production of science 
                      programmes using the electronic media, possibly also in 
                      regional languages and using "alternative" teaching methods. 
                      
                    The Academy will periodically assess the state of affairs in 
                      the country in each of the basic sciences, and publish its 
                      findings, along with recommendations as to where special 
                      efforts are needed. 
                      
                    The Academy proposes to launch a new journal accessible to university 
                      students and teachers in science and the educated lay public 
                      interested in science, featuring expository articles, description 
                      of new teaching methods and innovative experiments, science 
                      news, historical notes, etc.; the journal will contain advertisements 
                      from prospective employers, and information about opportunities 
                      for study and research. 
                      
                  Interaction with the Student and Teacher Communities 
                  
                    A scheme for placement of students with Fellows of the Academy 
                      for summer research programmes will be worked out. A similar 
                      programme will be undertaken for association of motivated 
                      college and school teachers. 
                      
                    A series of Academy seminars will be organised involving selected 
                      college teachers and promising students, on topics chosen 
                      with the guidance of Fellows. 
                      
                    An extension lecture programme in different regions with the 
                      cooperation of local colleges will be set up under Academy 
                      auspices. 
                      
                    The Academy will invite selected college and university teachers 
                      to its annual and mid-year meetings as guest participants. 
                      
                  Link with Teaching Departments and Institutions 
                  
                    The Academy will encourage university science departments and 
                      national laboratories to produce brochures containing helpful 
                      information for the guidance of students. 
                      
                  Contacts with National Bodies, Agencies, etc. 
                  
                    The Academy supports the introduction of a wide variety of undergraduate 
                      applied science courses, undergraduate science programmes 
                      of high quality in selected institutions, and Integrated 
                      M.Sc. programmes. At least a few of the undergraduate science 
                      programmes should be run at University Departments where 
                      postgraduate courses are also conducted, and not only at 
                      affiliated colleges. The Academy also recommends the setting 
                      up of Integrated Ph.D. programmes in selected institutions, 
                      with a suitable course programme as an integral part. 
                      
                    The Academy endorses the need for good M.Sc. courses in different 
                      branches of science, similar to the DBT programme.

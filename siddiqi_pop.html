                    in Molecular and Behavioural Genetics. Research covers microbial 
                    genetics and genetic neurobiology. With Garen discovered the 
                    suppressor of 'nonsense' mutations, which led to the elucidation 
                    of chain-terminating triplets in protein synthesis. Did some 
                    of the early experiments which show that recombinant bacteria 
                    inherit labelled DNA of biparental origin. At TIFR demonstrated 
                    that DNA transfer can be associated from replication and that 
                    recombinants arise from unreplicated DNA. In early seventies, 
                    turned to behavioural genetics and neurobiology of Drosophila. 
                    Carried out with the group pioneeering work on taste and smell 
                    in the fruitfly, opening up the prospect of integrated genetic 
                    and neurobiological study of chemosensory perception.

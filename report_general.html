                  4. GENERAL VIEWS OF THE ACADEMY PANEL 
                  In its own discussions the Academy Panel paid careful attention 
                    to many aspects of the overall problems of science education 
                    at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. This was against 
                    the background of the knowledge of the efforts of other groups 
                    and agencies, such as those briefly described in Section 3. 
                    
                  The discussions in the Panel and the large number of letters received 
                    by it from the Fellowship of the Academy brought home the 
                    point that there is a strong and unanimous feeling in the 
                    community both about the importance of science education and 
                    about the present alarmingly sorry state of affairs. The selection 
                    of commonly voiced concerns recounted in Section 2 appears 
                    to give a fair description of the present situation; urgent 
                    steps are necessary to avoid a crisis in the near future. 
                    The importance of science education of high quality, especially 
                    at the high school and undergraduate levels, cannot be over-emphasized 
                    in a country like ours. Science education becomes even more 
                    important in the-context of the present efforts of the country 
                    towards globalisation and a market economy. Perhaps too, much 
                    emphasis is being paid to the improved prospects for attracting 
                    foreign investment that the new climate in the country provides. 
                    But the basic objective of these new policies of the Government 
                    must be presumed to be to provide an opportunity for our own 
                    trained human power to create wealth for the nation by participating 
                    in and contributing to scientific and technological endeavours 
                    in India and across the globe. At the same time we need to 
                    support and strengthen our capacity to create, absorb and 
                    transform technology at various levels, and this can only 
                    be achieved against a background of solid foundations in the 
                    basic sciences. Clearly, we need to gear up our science education 
                    to meet these challenges if we are to fully reap the benefits, 
                    of the new economic policies. 
                    
                  At the same time, it seems very clear that the current state 
                    of university education in science, borrowed about a century 
                    ago from Britain and maintained essentially unchanged since 
                    then, is woefully inadequate to meet this challenge. Indeed, 
                    the Chairman of the 1966 Education Commission, Dr.D.S.Kothari, 
                    had forcefully expressed himself in the following words to 
                    the Minister for Education of the Government of India [10]: 
                    
                    
                  "If I may say so, the single most important thing needed now is 
                    to get out of the rigidity of the present system. In the rapidly 
                    changing world of today, one thing is certain: yesterday's 
                    educational system will not meet today's, and even less so, 
                    the need of tomorrow". 
                    
                  At a time when barriers between the traditional disciplines are 
                    breaking down, breadth and flexibility have to be key features 
                    of an educational system that expects to attract and retain 
                    gifted young people. 
                    
                  In suggesting possible solutions, the Panel discussed at length 
                    two crucial issues. One has to do with the apparently mutually 
                    incompatible demands for equity and excellence. The other 
                    has to do with the need to simultaneously provide adequate 
                    opportunities for both the small number of gifted students 
                    who may be able to enlarge the horizons of scientific knowledge, 
                    as well as the large number of students who need to be trained 
                    to contribute at diverse levels to the welfare of Indian society 
                    in an intelligent and competent way. The Academy has kept 
                    both these goals in mind in its proposals for improving the 
                    situation. 
                    
                  The Panel had extensive discussions on the issue of equity and 
                    excellence. It was unanimous in recognising that this issue 
                    is an extremely complex one with far-reaching ramifications 
                    and room for a variety of points of view. This Paper places 
                    on record the Academy's general thinking on this matter, not 
                    so much with the aim of suggesting definitive solutions, but 
                    rather with that of initiating a debate on the issue among 
                    academics in the country. Such a debate on the seemingly incompatible 
                    twin desires for equity and excellence is essential, and should 
                    not be left merely to the politicians and the judiciary, as 
                    is currently the case. Perhaps the reason for the present 
                    state of affairs is that academics are, rightly or wrongly, 
                    perceived as being concerned only with excellence and ignoring 
                    the issue of equity. With such a prevailing perception, it 
                    is not difficult to see that political measures have been 
                    seen as the only method of promoting the cause of equity. 
                    The situation can only change if the academic community faces 
                    the real need for achieving both equity and excellence and 
                    suggests ways of doing so. Many academics have asserted that 
                    merit should be the sole criterion for admission to educational 
                    institutions. There is no denying that such a rigid rule will 
                    considerably disadvantage many potentially able people, at 
                    least at the present time. Conversely, laws are being enacted 
                    in the country to set aside quotas of various types. It is 
                    equally clear that beyond a certain level such reservations 
                    will be counter-productive in the long run and harm the country 
                    as a whole, including the very segments that need to be brought 
                    into the country's social, educational and economic mainstream. 
                    
                    
                  The important question is whether there is a way that would promote 
                    social justice and at the same time preserve academic values. 
                    One promising possibility is to reorient our thinking so that 
                    we would be able to view the whole issue as one of equity 
                    and excellence rather than one of equity versus excellence. 
                    It is essential to recognise that for a variety of historical 
                    and social reasons, a very large segment of our population 
                    aspires to a college degree. This aspiration has to be met. 
                    However, this need not mean that all these hundreds of thousands 
                    of students must enroll in the same few monolithic B.Sc. or 
                    B.E. degree programmes. The situation may be compared to that 
                    prevailing in the U.S.A. towards the end of the last century: 
                    by deliberate planning and conscious effort the system supported 
                    a few centres of high excellence along with a large number 
                    of universities that successfully provided education of 'value 
                    to the vast majority seeking it. 
                    
                  In our present situation, it is essential to completely revamp 
                    the fundamental structure of our university education system. 
                    We need to enlarge the educational opportunities by several 
                    orders of magnitude and create such a rich menu of possibilities 
                    and opportunities that the problem of providing for equity 
                    gradually disappears and becomes virtually irrelevant. We 
                    need to develop a large number of different kinds of flexible 
                    undergraduate degree courses that will permit the channelling 
                    of students according to their aptitude and motivation, without 
                    depriving any segment of society. One way to do this would 
                    be to have a large variety of undergraduate degrees in "applied 
                    science", where the students get a thorough exposure to the 
                    fundamentals of different subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, 
                    Mathematics and Biology in the first year and then go on to 
                    learn specialised skills in chosen branches of science or 
                    technology. The system should also provide the flexibility 
                    for an individual to transfer from one institution to another, 
                    say after the first year, carrying credit for courses already 
                    taken, if such transfer helps fulfil the aspirations of the 
                    student in a better way. In this process, the advantages offered 
                    by distance education methods should also be exploited. When 
                    such a large and diverse set of opportunities does become 
                    available, the sensible thumb rule of using aptitude as the 
                    criterion for admission will, in all likelihood, cease to 
                    prove discriminatory towards anybody. 
                    
                  In the light of the above comments, Council proposes to set up 
                    a special Committee to examine these issues in greater depth, 
                    and to advise the Academy on the role it can play in bringing 
                    about this transformation in attitudes. The Academy is convinced 
                    that such a reorientation in thinking is about the only way 
                    to achieve equity while at the same time ensuring the advance 
                    of science to serve the needs of the country. 
                    
                  The views expressed above, along with the realization that different 
                    and appropriate strategies have to be planned for the large 
                    majority of students who need science education to run the 
                    country efficiently on the one hand, and those few who may 
                    take up careers in scientific research on the other, suggest 
                    that undergraduate education in science is best organized 
                    into three streams, to cater most effectively to the needs 
                    and aspirations of large numbers of young people. These might 
                    correspond, in purely organizational terms, to the framework 
                    proposed by the Planning Commission Working Group referred 
                    to earlier. In suggesting a three-stream system of education, 
                    this framework recognises the need for adopting diverse strategies 
                    for achieving the objectives of the system. The comments made 
                    above regarding a rich and diverse menu of degrees in applied 
                    science are most appropriate to the third stream mentioned 
                    above. The more specific comments which are grouped below 
                    under two major headings apply largely to the first two streams 
                    of this initiative. 
                    
                  Council's views on the functioning of Colleges and Universities, the 
                    roles of Government agencies, national laboratories and industry, 
                    are expressed through general recommendations in Section 5. 
                    
                    
                  A) Patterns for undergraduate and postgraduate science 
                    education 
                    
                  At the undergraduate (U.G.) level the basic aim should be to 
                    make the spirit and excitement of science come through, so 
                    that appreciation for science would remain with the student 
                    independently of what he or, she might do later. The U.G. 
                    course should be solid and broad based, providing a good foundation 
                    in at least two subjects, and should definitely avoid specialisation 
                    too early. Thus all U.G. students should take some common 
                    courses in physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology in 
                    the first two years, or perhaps select combinations from a 
                    core curriculum so designed that they will be exposed to the 
                    fundamentals of these basic subjects; then choose subjects 
                    in one or two of the four streams for the third year. This 
                    will avoid variations in levels of teaching in the main and 
                    subsidiary subjects. One may reduce the content of each major 
                    subject, but no subject would be left out. 
                    
                  There is often a tendency to sacrifice essential areas of the four 
                    major (P,C,M and B) to make room for trendy specialisations 
                    such as chemistry, theoretical computer science, and the like; 
                    or such "job-oriented bio-courses" as poultry, fisheries, 
                    sericulture, etc. These can come later; early specialization 
                    at the U.G. stage must be strongly opposed, as it leave with 
                    a weak conceptual foundation which is very difficult to make 
                    good later. This is especially true for those students who 
                    plan to go on to the postgraduate level and then possibly 
                    on to scientific research. For genuinely job-oriented courses, 
                    such as the "applied science" options referred to earlier, 
                    at least one year of good teaching of fundamentals is essential; 
                    this can then be followed by specialisations like those mentioned 
                    above, and many others. 
                    
                  Curricula can never be static, and should be constantly reviewed and 
                    improved. In the process, room must always be made for really 
                    new subjects, but not at the expense of the foundational courses. 
                    
                    
                  Experimental programmes should lay stress on open- ended exploratory experiments 
                    using simple materials where possible. Innovative experiments 
                    must be specially conceived and devised for this purpose. 
                    
                    
                  At the post-graduate (P.G.) level, the first year should concentrate 
                    chosen subject with common courses for all students within 
                    that discipline. Further specialization, choice of elective 
                    courses, and project and seminar work should form part of 
                    the second year, and then preferably in the second term. It 
                    is common experience that industry also prefers students who 
                    have gone through and common core curriculum, with no basic 
                    areas neglected, with specialization coming towards the end 
                    of the P.G. course. For example the two year M. Stat. programme 
                    of the I.S.I is a successful, solid course which has an established 
                    reputation over the years for P.G. education in the mathematical 
                    sciences. It provides the right degree of flexibility and 
                    specialization in the second year of the course. Some other 
                    examples are the M.Sc. course in General Chemistry in some 
                    I.I.T.'s and Central Universities. A similar approach would 
                    be most beneficial in all the other sciences. 
                    
                  With all four science subjects being offered to all students at 
                    the UG level for two years, we can hope to see such fruitful 
                    combinations of subjects as mathematics and biology or physics 
                    and biology being chosen by talented students at the later 
                    stages. The merging boundaries between different disciplines 
                    such as biology, chemistry, physics, etc provide us with challenges 
                    as opportunities. These should be reflected in the course 
                    options available at advanced levels. 
                    
                  B) Comments relating to individual subjects 
                  
                  Mathematics: It is a fact that mathematics syllabi of most universities 
                    read very well on paper; and excellent texts in the various 
                    areas are now available at affordable prices in the country. 
                    The tragedy is the way in which the subjects are taught at 
                    the U.G. level, leading to poor inputs at the P.G. level and 
                    then at the research stage. Classical mathematics presented 
                    well at the U.G. level would be a fine beginning. What is 
                    important is to convey the spirit of mathematics, and to develop 
                    such core subjects as analysis, differential equations, algebra 
                    and probability and statistics on solid foundations. 
                    
                  As stated in (a) above, specializations should be taken up only 
                    in the second year of the P.G. course, not earlier. There 
                    is also a general need to drop obsolete courses and improve 
                    the content of applied mathematics wherever it is offered. 
                    
                    
                  Physics: The same weakness at the U.G. level seen in mathematics afflicts 
                    physics as well. We need more devoted U.G. teachers able to 
                    convey concepts and illustrate the unity of physics clearly. 
                    Such subjects as atomic and molecular physics and quantum 
                    mechanics often get short shrift in favour of various early 
                    specialisations. At the P.G. level the core should consist 
                    of classical mechanics, classical electrodynamics, statistical 
                    thermodynamics and quantum mechanics, again with specialisation 
                    only towards the end in the final term. At the P.G. level 
                    and later, physics students should preferably learn the mathematics 
                    they need from mathematicians. A major improvement is required 
                    in the way that laboratory training is imparted and the so-called 
                    practical classes are conducted. 
                    
                  Chemistry: The traditional division of this subject into inorganic, organic 
                    and physical chemistry has outlived its usefulness and is 
                    now doing more harm than good. It leads to loss of a sense 
                    of the unity of the subject, lack of appreciation of basic 
                    principles' and too early branching into narrow specialisations. 
                    Starting from the U.G. stage, chemistry should be taught as 
                    based on the trinity of bonding, structure and reactivity. 
                    This is not an easy task, but at least at some universities 
                    in the country the effort to change in this direction must 
                    be made. 
                    
                  At the P.G. level the core in physical chemistry, for instance, 
                    should consist of thermodynamics, chemical dynamics, quantum 
                    chemistry and statistical mechanics. Also at the P.G. level, 
                    the interfaces of chemistry with biology and with physics 
                    should be brought out in some detail-, and the transition 
                    from molecular to macroscopic behaviour made clear. The comments 
                    about laboratory exercises apply as strongly to chemistry 
                    as they do to physics. 
                    
                  Biology: This is an extremely rapidly changing subject, which incidentally 
                    should be distinguished from biotechnology! An approach stressing 
                    unity in the various branches of the life sciences, both at 
                    the U.G. and P.G. levels, should be possible. Students of 
                    biology need to know allied subjects rather well. In this 
                    respect it is realized that many aspects of the subject can 
                    be learnt informally by motivated students on their own, while 
                    receiving more formal training in Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics.

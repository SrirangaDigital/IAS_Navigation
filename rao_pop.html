                    Sc. Work in Solid State Chemistry, Surface Science, Spectroscopy 
                    and Molecular Structure. Contributed widely to several aspects 
                    of spectroscopy and structure by employing vibrational, electronic 
                    and high-energy spectroscopies. Besides complex molecules, 
                    has investigated molecular interactions by these techniques. 
                    An important area of vital interest to which monumental contributions 
                    have been made is solid state chemistry. In this area, carried 
                    out extensive studies related to tailor-making of complex 
                    solids, structure-property relations, defect solids, phase 
                    transitions, superconducting materials and novel synthetic 
                    methods. Also contributed significantly to surface science, 
                    fullerenes and metal clusters. Publ.: New Directions in Solid

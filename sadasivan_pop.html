                    Bhushan 74. Sc. Work in Plant Pathology. Worked on model host-parasite 
                    systems and followed up the biochemical changes in the host 
                    plants as the disease syndrome progressed. While working on 
                    the toxin pyriculol produced by this blast fungus demonstrated 
                    permeability changes in the host tissues. Furthermore it was 
                    demonstrated for the first time that the toxins of the fungus 
                    induced 'green islands' in rice leaf tissues. Work on the 
                    cotton wilt problem caused by the soil inhabiting fungus Fusarium 
                    vasinfectum led to a better understanding of rhizosphere effect 
                    where the role of root exudates in promoting the growth and 
                    survival of specific pathogens became well established. First 
                    ever demonstration of the fungal toxin fusaric acid in vivo 
                    led to designating this toxin as a vivotoxin and was advanced 
                    by the group. Put forward definitive evidence of ionic imbalance 
                    in wilted plants in the form of excessive excretion and enhanced 
                    transpiration resulting in loss of potassium and accumulation 
                    of divalent cations. The other host-parasite system studied 
                    was the blast disease of rice caused by the air-borne fungus 
                    Pyricularia oryzae.

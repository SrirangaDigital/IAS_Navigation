<p>Journal of Chemical Sciences is a monthly journal published by the Indian Academy of Sciences. It formed a part of the original Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences â€“ Part A, started by the Nobel Laureate Prof. C V Raman in 1934, that was split in 1978 into three separate journals.</p>
<p>The journal publishes original research articles and rapid communications, covering all areas of chemical sciences. A significant feature of the journal is its special issues, brought out from time to time, devoted to conference symposia/proceedings in frontier areas of the subject, held not only in India but also in other countries. The journal accords great importance to the quality of articles published, with stringent peer review, and to keeping the time required for processing of papers to a minimum by constant endeavour.</p>
<p>To maintain excellence in this regard, the journal has an Editorial Board comprising eminent chemists from all over the country specializing in different areas in chemistry and a panel of internationally reputed referees.</p>

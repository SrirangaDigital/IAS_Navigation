Work in Physical and Mechanical Alloy Development. Contributions in X-ray diffraction study of structural imperfections include development of new methods of analysis of X-ray line-broadening and prediction and experimental verification of fault configurations in double hexagonal close- packed crystals. With regard to correlation of mechanical behaviour with micro structures work relates to high strain fatigue at ambient and elevated temperatures, creep at low (mass transport controlled) and intermediate (dislocation climb controlled) stresses, creep fracture and the effect of thermo mechanically-induced substructure on Dynamic strain ageing and fracture characteristics of titanium and its alloys. A major recent research programme addressed basic issue of fracture toughness in single phase and dilute alloys. Much of the current work is devoted to alloy development with a view to ensure their application and the latest contributions pertain to development and application of specialty structural steels.</p>

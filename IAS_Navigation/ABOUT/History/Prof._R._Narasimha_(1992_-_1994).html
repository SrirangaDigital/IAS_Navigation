American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Chmn, Asian Fluid Mechanics Committee; Foreign Associate, Nation-al Acad. of Engg, USA. Bhatnagar Award 76; Padmabhushan 87. Sc. Work in Fluid Mechanics, Aerospace Engineering and Atmospheric Sciences, Contributed in a large way to improve understanding of flows in transition from laminar to turbulent state and the reverse. Developed a widely used model for the intermittency distribution in the transition zone of a boundary layer. Experimental investigation on relaminarization led to the identifica-tion of three basic types. Conducted investigations of fundamental importance for understanding structure and memory of fully turbulent flows. Discovered Navier-Stokes type constitutive relations in free-molecule flow of a gas cloud and obtained solutions for the structure of a shock wave with the use of novel group-theoretic methods. Derived equations for the nonlinear motion of an elastic string. Investigated a real-life airworthiness problem of an aircraft. Specified International Tropical Reference Atmosphere for aviation authorities. Has been closely associated with the development of aerospace technology in the country.</p>

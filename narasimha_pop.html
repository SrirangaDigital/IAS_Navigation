                    Padmabhushan 87. Sc. Work in Fluid Mechanics, Aerospace Engineering 
                    and Atmospheric Sciences, Contributed in a large way to improve 
                    understanding of flows in transition from laminar to turbulent 
                    state and the reverse. Developed a widely used model for the 
                    intermittency distribution in the transition zone of a boundary 
                    layer. Experimental investigation on relaminarization led 
                    to the
                    identifica-tion of three basic types. Conducted investigations 
                    of fundamental importance for understanding structure and 
                    memory of fully turbulent flows. Discovered Navier-Stokes 
                    type constitutive relations in free-molecule flow of a gas 
                    cloud and obtained solutions for the structure of a shock 
                    wave with the use of novel group-theoretic methods. Derived 
                    equations for the nonlinear motion of an elastic string. Investigated 
                    a real-life airworthiness problem of an aircraft. Specified 
                    International Tropical Reference Atmosphere for aviation authorities. 
                    Has been closely associated with the development of aerospace 
                    technology in the country.

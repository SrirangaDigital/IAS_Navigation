                  The Indian Academy of Sciences endeavours 
                    by all means at its disposal to promote the progress and uphold 
                    the cause of science, both in pure and applied branches.
                    
                    It is the responsibility of the Fellows of the Academy, to 
                    individually and collectively, promote original research and 
                    disseminate scientific knowledge to the community, through 
                    its meetings, discussions, seminars, symposia and publications.
                    
                    The Academy recognises the special relationship of scientific 
                    creative activity with the process of education and holds 
                    that the course of discovery includes the identification and 
                    nurturing of scientific talent amongst the young.
                    
                    The Academy upholds that the principle of social responsibility 
                    for all scientific effort, individual or corporate, is entirely 
                    consistent with individual freedom and that the quest for 
                    knowledge and truth cannot be reconciled with any dogma.
                    
                    The Council has, as a first step, expanded the Fellowship, 
                    in order to have within the Academy a fuller representation 
                    of the Indian scientific community in its corporate body so 
                    that the objectives and obligations of the Academy could be 
                    more effectively fulfilled.
                    
                    The other steps proposed are aimed at:
                    
                      Ensuring that there is full representation 
                        in the Academy of all branches of science, fundamental 
                        and applied.
                    
                    
                      Placing special emphasis on bringing 
                        outstanding young scientists into the fold of the Academy, 
                        through election to the Fellowship.
                    
                    
                      Promoting high quality journals in order 
                        to provide publication opportunities to Indian scientists 
                        at the international level.
                    
                    
                      Conducting symposia and seminars and 
                        encouraging other similar activities in order to provide 
                        means of exchange of scientific knowledge among scientists 
                        and to bring new knowledge to the attention of the whole 
                        scientific community.
                    
                    
                      Recognising, and honouring excellence 
                        in various areas of science by the institution of special 
                        awards (in the form of medals, lectureships, etc.)
                    
                    
                      Giving special encouragement to young 
                        scientists by the award of scholarships and fellowships 
                        to enable them to pursue their particular interests.
                    
                    
                      Promoting international understanding 
                        in science through the institution of special chairs and 
                        professorships, which will allow scientists from abroad 
                        to visit India for specific periods and provide means 
                        for travel for Indian scientists to visit other countries.
                    
                     
                      Taking up integrated studies in specific 
                        fields where co-ordinated scientific activities tend to 
                        be neglected.
                        
                        The Academy affirms that the rightful place for science 
                        and the men who rigorously cultivate it can be assured 
                        in society primarily through their devotion to the principles 
                        of objectivity, integrity and freedom from dogmas rather 
                        than through any formal processes of recognition.
                        
                        Not unmindful of the crucial role the Academy can play 
                        in national regeneration, the Academy adheres to the belief 
                        that this ideal would be best served by preserving the 
                        independence of the Academy from all official, State or 
                        Organisation-related channels.
                        
                        Fellows of the Academy, promote by personal as well as 
                        collective example, the principle of rational thought 
                        of function and relevance, rather than precedents.
                        
                        By applying rigorous standards of scientific criticism 
                        at all levels in a constructive sense, the Academy considers 
                        that the scientific community has a unique contribution 
                        to make not only to the flowering of science in India 
                        but also to national character.

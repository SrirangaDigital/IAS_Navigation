                                    Sciences had in January 2003
                                    constituted a <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/womeninscience/committee1.html">committee</a>
                                    on "Women in Science" to look into
                                    the issues of women scientists. This
                                    led to the formation of&nbsp;a <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/womeninscience/panel.htm" class="style19">Panel</a>
                                    for "Women in Science" (WiS), in

                                    women scientists and to suggest
                                    measures for obtaining suitable
                                    solutions.&nbsp;
                              The Panel is currently chaired by Prof.
                                        Rohini M Godbole. The Panel has
                                        undertaken several <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/womeninscience/initiative.htm">initiatives</a>
                                        towards fulfilling its
                                        objectives.

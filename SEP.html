				Indian Academy of Sciences
				
				<a href="#image"><img src="Science%20Education%20Panel_files/cvraman33.jpg" alt="C.V Raman"></a> 
				Indian Academy of Sciences 
				     was founded in 1934 by Sir C.V. Raman, Nobel Laureate. Its 
objectives include promoting the progress and upholding the cause of 
science, both in pure and applied branches. The Academy recognizes the 
special relationship of scientific creative activity with the process of
 education and holds that the course of discovery includes the 
identification and nurturing of scientific talent amongst the young.
				
				In 1994, the Academy brought out a document on University Science 
Education containing several recommendations. The Council of the Academy
 then set up a Science Education Panel to organize a variety of 
programmes for teachers and students of science all over India, and to 
bring them into beneficial contacts with the Fellowship of the Academy.
				
				Starting in the mid-1990s, the Indian Academy of Sciences had 
initiated several activities for the benefit of students and teachers of
 science all over the country. These included (a) Summer Research 
Fellowships for students and teachers to work with Fellows of the 
academy and other faculty in the country; (b) Refresher Courses of 
two-week duration for teachers; (c) Lecture Workshops of 2 or 3 days 
duration for students and teachers; (d) Inviting teachers to attend the 
Mid-Year and Annual Meetings of the Academy.
				
				Indian Academy of Sciences also started the publication of a monthly journal of science education — <i>Resonance </i>in January 1996. Now in its second decade of publication, <i> Resonance </i>carries
 articles in all areas of science and engineering. This journal is 
primarily directed at students and teachers at the undergraduate level, 
though some of the articles may go beyond this range. 
				
				In January 2007, the Indian National Science Academy (New Delhi) and
 The National Academy of Sciences, India (Allahabad) joined with this 
Academy in conducting three of the programmes viz Summer Research 
Fellowships, Refresher Courses, and Lecture Workshops.

				Words of wisdom

I profess to learn and to teach anatomy not from books but from 
dissections, not from the tenets of Philosophers but from the fabric of 
Nature. 

--William Harvey

It is always noteworthy that all those who seriously study this science 
[the theory of numbers] conceive a sort of passion for it. 
-- Carl Friedrich Gauss

I have no satisfaction in formulas unless I feel their arithmetical magnitude. 
-- Baron William Thomson Kelvin

I try to identify myself with the atoms ... I ask what I would do If I were a carbon atom or a sodium atom.
-- Linus Pauling

There is no area of the world that should not be investigated by 
scientists. There will always remain some questions that have not been 
answered. In general, these are the questions that have not yet been 
posed. 
-- Linus Pauling

The whole history of science has been the gradual realization that 
events do not happen in an arbitrary manner, but that they reflect a 
certain underlying order, which may or may not be divinely inspired. 
-- Stephen W. Hawking

What is that we human beings ultimately depend on? We depend on our 
words. We are suspended in language. Our task is to communicate 
experience and ideas to others. 
-- Niels Bohr

A scientist is happy, not in resting on his attainments but in the steady acquisition of fresh knowledge. 
-- Max Planck

Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is 
because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are part of nature and 
therefore part of the mystery that we are trying to solve. 
-- Max Planck

Nature is made in such a way as to be able to be understood. Or perhaps I
 should put it-more correctly-the other way around, and say that we are 
made in such a way as to be able to understand Nature. 
--  Werner Heisenberg

Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns, so that each
 small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire 
tapestry. 
-- Richard P. Feynman

Plato is my friend, Aristotle is my friend, but my greatest friend is truth. 
-- Sir Isaac Newton

Nature does nothing in vain when less will serve; for Nature is pleased 
with simplicity and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes. 
-- Sir Isaac Newton

Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things. 
-- Sir Isaac Newton

Everything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labor in freedom. 
-- Albert Einstein
Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. 
-- Albert Einstein

When you look at yourself from a universal standpoint, something inside 
always reminds or informs you that there are bigger and better things to
 worry about. 
-- Albert Einstein
Ethical axioms are found and tested not very differently from the axioms
 of science. Truth is what stands the test of experience. 
-- Albert Einstein

Imagination is more important than knowledge. 
-- Albert Einstein

The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. 
-- Albert Einstein

The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is at all comprehensible. 
-- Albert Einstein

Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value. 
-- Albert Einstein

                    90; IIM Tata Gold Medal 91; Gold Medal 94. Sc. Work in Physical 
                    and Mechanical Alloy Development. Contributions in X-ray diffraction 
                    study of structural imperfections include development of new 
                    methods of analysis of X-ray line-broadening and prediction 
                    and experimental verification of fault configurations in double 
                    hexagonal close- packed crystals. With regard to correlation 
                    of mechanical behaviour with micro structures work relates 
                    to high strain fatigue at ambient and elevated temperatures, 
                    creep at low (mass transport controlled) and intermediate 
                    (dislocation climb controlled) stresses, creep fracture and 
                    the effect of thermo mechanically-induced substructure on 
                    Dynamic strain ageing and fracture characteristics of titanium 
                    and its alloys. A major recent research programme addressed 
                    basic issue of fracture toughness in single phase and dilute 
                    alloys. Much of the current work is devoted to alloy development 
                    with a view to ensure their application and the latest contributions 
                    pertain to development and application of specialty structural 
                    steels.

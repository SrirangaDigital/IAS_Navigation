Sponsored by:<b>Indian Academy of Sciences, BangaloreIndian National Science Academy, New DelhiThe National Academy of Sciences India, Allahabad</b>in collaboration with<b>Department of Life Sciences, Sophia College, Mumbai</b>

<b>23 November to 8 December 2011</b>, at Sophia College, Mumbai
                  
One of the major challenges of science education is the rapidly changing technology that needs to be integrated with the teaching&ndash;learning process so that high benchmarks in education are sustained. Technology transfers from research labs to educationists involve lasting interactions and this is what we propose to initiate in this Science Academies Refresher Course on 'Techniques in neurosciences&mdash;from behaviour to molecules'.  Neuroscience is increasingly included in undergraduate and postgraduate syllabi and techniques used in this area deserve focussed consideration. This refresher course aims at providing hands-on training in model systems to study neurosciences at organismic, cellular and molecular levels.  The course will also comprise lecture-demonstration sessions on advanced techniques in elucidating gene expression. While the theme remains neurosciences, the techniques have wider applications and would be of use to almost all biology teachers including those teaching biotechnology, zoology, microbiology and life sciences.
                  
                  
Individuals who wish to participate in the course may apply with the following details: name, date of birth, sex, e-mail address, official and residential addresses, telephone numbers, academic qualifications, courses taught, position held, and a brief statement indicating the reasons for interest in participating in the course. Outstation candidates will be provided accommodation and round-trip bus/train fare (three-tier AC) by the shortest route.

Sponsored by Indian Academy of Sciences, Bangalore in collaboration with International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad
                  
12 to 17 June 2006 at IIIT, Hyderabad
                  
Biology today, in the post-genomic era, occupies the forefront in a multitude of recent scientific and technological developments. With biology interfacing with almost all walks of life, a typical bio-related R&amp;D environment today has an interface with skills in diverse areas of mathematics and statistics, physical sciences, engineering and computational sciences. Research in the area of computational natural sciences is thus an exciting and rapidly emerging career option for science graduates who have an aptitude for mathematics and computations. This Workshop will consist of interactive lectures, hands on problem-solving, and interactive feedback sessions and will be a guided tour through the frontiers of scientific research involving physics, chemistry, biology and computers. 
Professors D. Balasubramanian (LVPEI, Hyderabad), R. Ramaswamy (JNU, New Delhi), Ashok Mallik (IIT, Kanpur), R. Gadagkar (IISc, Bangalore), Indira Ghosh and Shridhar R. Gadre (Pune University), H. A. Nagarajaram and Shekhar C. Mande (CDFD, Hyderabad), Rahul Siddharthan (IMS, Hyderabad), Rajgopal Srinivasan (TCS, Hyderabad), B. Jayaram (IIT, Delhi), Ramesh Hariharan (Strand Life Sciences), Amitabh Joshi (JNCASR, Bangalore), Ashesh Prosad Mitra (NPL, New Delhi), Prasad V. Bharatam (NIPER, Punjab) will be the resource persons for this course. 
Interested candidates should send in their application on plain paper along with their curriculum vitae, date of birth, qualifications, two letters of references and a statement of purpose (approx. 500 words) describing your research interest. Students currently in their second/third year of B.Sc. with Honours (major) in Physics/Chemistry may write to:

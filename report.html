                  1. Introduction 
                  In recent years the Academy has felt increasingly 
                    concerned with the state of university education in science 
                    in the country. It has been widely realized that without a 
                    proper base in education it will not be possible to promote 
                    progress in science to attain the excellence that is a major 
                    concern of the Academy. <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/initiat/sci_ed/report_intro.html">More ..</a>
                  
                  2. DIMENSIONS AND COMMON PERCEPTIONS OF 
                    THE PROBLEM 
                  Although the main focus of this document 
                    is university science education particularly at the undergraduate 
                    level, it is realized that undergraduate education is part 
                    of a continuum, starting with education at the school level 
                    and going on to research in science. <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/initiat/sci_ed/report_dim.html">More

                    3. EARLIER SUGGESTIONS AND PROGRAMMES FOR COORDINATED ACTION 
                    
                  In the face of the deteriorating situation 
                    described in the previous Section, there have been several 
                    carefully thought-out suggestions for positive action made 
                    by responsible and concerned academic groups in the country.

                    4. GENERAL VIEWS OF THE ACADEMY PANEL 
                  In its own discussions the Academy Panel paid careful attention 
                    to many aspects of the overall problems of science education 
                    at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. This was against 
                    the background of the knowledge of the efforts of other groups 
                    and agencies, such as those briefly described in Section 3.

                  5. RECOMMENDATIONS 
                  The recommendations are presented here in 
                    two groups: first those that involve national bodies, agencies, 
                    the educational system, research laboratories and industry; 
                    second, those that depend mainly on initiatives to be taken 
                    by the Academy. Some overlap with the views presented in Section 
                    4 is retained to make the recommendations self-contained.

                    6. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS 
                  General Recommendations 
                  Functioning of Colleges and Universities 
                    
                    Universities and colleges should satisfy the minimum requirement 
                      of running on schedule in all respects. <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/initiat/sci_ed/report_summary.html">More

<p>Report on University Science Education</p>

<p>1. Introduction</p>

<p>In recent years the Academy has felt increasingly 
concerned with the state of university education in science 
in the country. It has been widely realized that without a 
proper base in education it will not be possible to promote 
progress in science to attain the excellence that is a major 
concern of the Academy. <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/initiat/sci_ed/report_intro.html">More ..</a></p>

<p>2. DIMENSIONS AND COMMON PERCEPTIONS OF 
THE PROBLEM</p>

<p>Although the main focus of this document 
is university science education particularly at the undergraduate 
level, it is realized that undergraduate education is part 
of a continuum, starting with education at the school level 
and going on to research in science. <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/initiat/sci_ed/report_dim.html">More

<p>3. EARLIER SUGGESTIONS AND PROGRAMMES FOR COORDINATED ACTION</p>

<p>In the face of the deteriorating situation 
described in the previous Section, there have been several 
carefully thought-out suggestions for positive action made 
by responsible and concerned academic groups in the country.

<p>4. GENERAL VIEWS OF THE ACADEMY PANEL</p>

<p>In its own discussions the Academy Panel paid careful attention 
to many aspects of the overall problems of science education 
at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. This was against 
the background of the knowledge of the efforts of other groups 
and agencies, such as those briefly described in Section 3.

<p>5. RECOMMENDATIONS</p>

<p>The recommendations are presented here in 
two groups: first those that involve national bodies, agencies, 
the educational system, research laboratories and industry; 
second, those that depend mainly on initiatives to be taken 
by the Academy. Some overlap with the views presented in Section 
4 is retained to make the recommendations self-contained.

<p>General Recommendations
Functioning of Colleges and Universities</p>

<p>Universities and colleges should satisfy the minimum requirement 
of running on schedule in all respects. <a href="http://www.ias.ac.in/initiat/sci_ed/report_summary.html">More
